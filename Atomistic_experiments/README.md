This part of the repository is structures as follows:
- `data`: contains the data used in the experiments
- `materials_model_predictions`: contains the predictions of the different models

In order to work with the trajectory data, first unzip the file `trajectory.zip` in the `Atomistic_experiments` directory. This will create a new directory `trajectory` containing the trajectory data.
```
unzip trajectory.zip
```
